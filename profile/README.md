>Who are we and what we do?

We are a high-school robotics team from No.2 High School Of East China Normal University Zizhu Campus that gives students opportunities to experience real world engineering through competitive robotics. We attend FRC(FIRST Robotics Competition)

>How to join us?

Since we are currently not a public organization, you must first be enrolled in the No. 2 High School of the East China Normal University Zizhu Campus before you can join us. You can then decide whether to join the FRC club! Additionally, if you're interested in joining our team as a mentor, get in touch with our mentor [William Guo](https://github.com/williamguowei) for additional details!

>Why we create this organization in Github?

Firstly,Â l(mendax1234) primarily borrowed this idea fromÂ other foreign FRC teams. Throughout my FRC career, I have discovered that the lack of resources in terms of mechanisms and programming is the main reason why FRC teams in my nation are unable to compete with the other top FRC Teams (such as Orbit1690, TheCheesyPoofs254, and so on). So, I made the decision to start this organization and offer all the tools I've discovered over my FRC career in order to raise the general programming standard of FRC teams in China. I sincerely believe that these tools will enable our high school students to quickly understand the trickiest FRC programming concepts! In addition, I want to extend this "Gracious Professionalism" throughout the entire FIRST community.
