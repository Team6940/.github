![Total Visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Team6940.Team6940)

>Who we are and what we do?

We are a high-school robotics team from No.2 High School Of East China Normal University Zizhu Campus that gives students opportunities to experience real world engineering through competitive robotics. We attend FRC(FIRST Robotics Competition)

>How to join us?

We are not a public organization now so if you want to join us , you must be a student in the No.2 High School Of East China Normal University Zizhu Campus first. Then you can choose to join the FRC club! What's more, if you want to become a mentor in our team, you should contact our mentor [William_Guo](https://github.com/williamguowei) for further information!

>Why we create this organization in Github?

Firstly, l([mendax1234](https://github.com/mendax1234)) mainly borrow this idea from the foreign FRC teams. During my FRC career,l find that the main reason why FRC teams in my country aren't able to compete with the other world's toppest FRC Team(like Orbit1690, TheCheesyPoofs 254 and so on) is that we don't have much resources both in mechanisms and programming. So, in order to improve the overall programming level of FRC teams in China. I decide to create this organization and share *all* the resources (mainly in the programming and software) l have found in my FRC career. l really hope these resources can help our high schools students master the most difficult programming skills in FRC more quickly!  Besides ,l also want to spread this *Gracious Professionalism* not only to more teams in our country but also in the whole FIRST community.
